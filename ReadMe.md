Known issues
------------

- Hitting Reset during a WeeGUI application will leave your Apple II in an unsafe state.
- Calling WGEraseView on a view that shares border rendering with other views will require manually redrawing those views.
- Included sample ASMDEMO has a slight tendancy to step on ProDOS's buffers. This is mostly harmless.
